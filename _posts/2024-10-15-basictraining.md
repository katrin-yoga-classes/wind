The Basic Training comprises 40 lessons, and is spread over 2 years. Each lesson is split into three main parts: Asanas (physical exercises), Meditation (energy exercises), and Theory. 

The lesson scheme is taken over from my Raja Yoga teacher [Arjuna](www.yogae.org), who himself has taken it over from his teacher [Ajita](https://rajayoga.home.xs4all.nl/EN/).
